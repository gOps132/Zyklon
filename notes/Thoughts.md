Im thinking about reworking the "solution"
it's too messy to have 2 project working at once
for me I just want one Zyklon directory with an examples directory
for the sandbox

I am also having doubts on the mugit tool that I am using, it seems
that it's just some extra overhead, most modules that I am using seems to
be on branch master, and everytime that I mugit pull the module does not 
checkout on the specified branch which seems like a joke, because that's the
purpose of the tool in the first place.
