Plans for future features on this graphics engine

* ffmpeg decoded video to openGL frames and SCALE
* output 3d render frames to video
* serialization which means more abstraction in 3d states to render this serialized data.
    * I could use a single header library for the serialization but 
    where is the fun in that? :)
